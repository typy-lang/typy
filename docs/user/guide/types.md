# Types and annotations

Every value in a TyPy program has one type, fixed when the program is
compiled. Functions are annotated; variables take the type of their first
value.

## What TyPy 0.2 accepts

| Item | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Annotations on every function parameter, except `self`, and on every return | TYP-01 |
| A variable without an annotation takes the type of its first assignment | TYP-02 |
| Assigning a value of another type to a variable is refused | TYP-03 |
| Inference stays inside one function | TYP-04 |
| An empty `[]`, `{}`, `set()` or `dict()` needs an annotation or a typed context | TYP-05 |
| `list[T]`, `dict[K, V]`, `set[T]`, `tuple[A, B]`, `tuple[T, ...]` and `T \| None` | TYP-06 |
| An `int` is refused where a `float` is declared, since CPython keeps it an `int` | TYP-09 |
| `typing.Any`, `typing.cast` and `object` annotations are refused | TYP-10 |
| A variable read before it is assigned on every path is refused | TYP-12 |
| `T \| None` narrows to `T` after `is not None`, a failed `is None` test or a truth test | TYP-13 |

Unions of other types, such as `int | str`, come with `isinstance` in 0.4
(TYP-14).

## Example

<!-- typy-expect: accepted -->
```python
def find(names: list[str], wanted: str) -> int | None:
    for index, name in enumerate(names):
        if name == wanted:
            return index
    return None


scores: dict[str, list[float]] = {}
scores["ada"] = [9.5, 8.0]
position = find(["ada", "alan"], "alan")
if position is not None:
    print("found at", position + 1)
print(scores, find([], "x"))
```

An optional value must be tested before it is used as its base type:

```python
limit: int | None = None
print(limit + 1)
```
