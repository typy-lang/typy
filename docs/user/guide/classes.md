# Classes

Classes are standard Python classes. Every attribute is declared in the
class body or assigned in `__init__`, and has one type.

## What TyPy 0.2 accepts

| Item | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Classes with `__init__`, methods and attributes declared in the body or assigned in `__init__` | CLS-01 |
| Assigning or calling a name the class does not have is refused | CLS-02 |
| `__str__` and `__repr__`, used by `print`, `str`, `repr`, f-strings and containers | CLS-08 |
| A type object for every type, with `object` as the root | CLS-10 |
| `type(x)`, class and built-in type names as values, `__name__` | CLS-12 |

Inside `__init__`, `self` is only used to assign and read attributes until
every attribute holds a value, so no attribute is ever read empty. A
signature that names its own class, or a class defined below it, quotes
the name, such as `"Node | None"`.

Instances are equal only to themselves and hashed by identity; operator
methods such as `__eq__` come in 0.4 (CLS-07), with inheritance (CLS-04),
`@dataclass` (CLS-05), `@property` (CLS-06) and `isinstance` (CLS-09).
Exception classes come in 0.3 (CLS-03), and class variables in 0.4
(CLS-11).

## Example

<!-- typy-expect: accepted -->
```python
class Account:
    owner: str

    def __init__(self, owner: str, balance: int = 0) -> None:
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance
        self.history: list[int] = []

    def deposit(self, amount: int) -> None:
        self.balance += amount
        self.history.append(amount)

    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return f"Account({self.owner!r}, {self.balance})"


class Node:
    def __init__(self, value: int, next: "Node | None" = None) -> None:
        self.value = value
        self.next = next


account = Account("ada")
account.deposit(50)
chain = Node(1, Node(2))
print(account, account.history, [account], type(account).__name__)
print(chain.value, chain.next is not None, type(chain) is Node)
```

An attribute the class does not declare cannot be added:

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.x = 0
point = Point()
point.z = 1
```
